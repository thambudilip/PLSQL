Nested Table:

A nested table is an ordered, variable-size collection that is defined as a database table type.
It can be stored in a database column.
It supports SQL operations and can be queried using SQL.
Nested tables can be extended and deleted from, and they support multilevel nesting.
Syntax for defining a nested table type and using it:


-- Define a nested table type
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE NameList AS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(50);

-- Declare and use a nested table
DECLARE
   names NameList := NameList('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie');
BEGIN
   names.EXTEND; -- Add an element
   names(4) := 'David'; -- Assign a value to the new element
   -- Iterate through the elements
   FOR i IN 1..names.COUNT LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(names(i));
   END LOOP;
END;


Associative Array (PL/SQL Table):

An associative array is an unordered collection that uses a unique key to access elements.
It is defined in PL/SQL, doesn't have a corresponding database table, and is not persisted in the database.
It is manipulated entirely within a PL/SQL block and does not support multilevel nesting.
Syntax for defining an associative array type and using it:

DECLARE
   TYPE NameList IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(50) INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
   names NameList;
BEGIN
   names(1) := 'Alice';
   names(2) := 'Bob';
   names(3) := 'Charlie';
   -- You can access elements using unique keys
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(names(2)); -- Output: Bob
END;
